											<h4 style="font-size: 17px;">Symptoms</h4>
											<p>
												Skin disease symptoms vary significantly, depending on what condition you have. Skin changes are not always due to skin diseases. For example, 
												you may get a blister from wearing ill-fitting shoes. However, when skin changes show up with no known cause, they may be linked to an underlying condition.

										<h2><a href='{{ url_for("skincan") }}'>Skin Disorders</a></h2>
										<p style="text-align:justify;">
											Skin disorders vary greatly in symptoms and severity. They can be temporary or permanent, and may
											be painless or painful. Some have situational causes, while others may be genetic. Some skin conditions
											are minor, and others can be life-threatening. While most skin disorders are minor, others can indicate
											a more serious issue. Contact your doctor if you think you might have one of these common skin problems.

											<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Acne and Rosacea</b></h3>
										</header>
										
										<p style="text-align: justify;">
											Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.
										</p>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">
											Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. The 4 main factors that cause acne
											are excess oil production, hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells, bacteria and inflammation. Risk
											factors for acne include age, hormonal changes, family history, greasy or oily substances and friction or pressure on your skin.

											<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Psoriasis</b></h3>
										</header>
										
										<p>
											Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes red, itchy scaly patches, most commonly on the knees, elbows, trunk and scalp.
											Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It tends to go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a while or going into remission.
										</p>
										<p>
											Psoriasis patches can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas. The most commonly affected areas are the lower back, elbows, knees, legs, soles of the feet, scalp, face and palms.
											Risk factors for psoriasis include family history, stress and smoking.
										</p>

										<header>
											<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Melanoma</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. It is not the most common, but it is the most serious, as it often spreads. When this happens, 
											it can be difficult to treat, and the outlook may be poor.
											Risk factors for melanoma include overexposure to the sun, having fair skin, and a family history of melanoma, among others.
										</p>
										<p>
											It is a type of skin cancer that occurs when pigment producing cells called melanocytes mutate and begin to divide uncontrollably.
											Most pigment cells develop in the skin. Melanomas can develop anywhere on the skin, but certain areas are more at risk than others.
											 In men, it is most likely to affect the chest and back. In women, the legs are the most common site. Other common sites of melanoma 
											include the face.						
											However, melanoma can also occur in the eyes and other parts of the body, including — on very rare occasions — the intestines.											
											It is relatively rare in people with darker skin.

											<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Vasculitis</b></h3>
										</header>
										
										<p>
											Vasculitis involves inflammation of the blood vessels. The inflammation can cause the walls of the blood vessels to thicken, which reduces the width of the passageway through the vessel. If blood flow is restricted, it can result in organ and tissue damage.
											Vasculitis can affect anyone, though some types are more common among certain age groups. 
										</p>
										<p>
											The exact cause of vasculitis isn't fully understood. Some types are related to a person's genetic makeup. Others result from the immune system attacking blood vessel cells by mistake.
											Risk factors for vasculitis include age, family history, lifestyle choices, medications, infections, etc.
