# Skin_Disease_Assessment

A website which would classify dermoscopic images among different diagnostic categories. In our website, the user will need to provide the image of the affected area of the skin and our model would tell the user about the percentage of the disease that they are facing. Along with this, we would be giving the information about the dermatologist and their clinic’s address nearby the user’s location.
